# DIY-Sha256
Two programs that use SHA256 algorithm to hash  passwords and the contents of files.

Sha256MultiBlock.py is a program that hashes messages. Coded in the Python programming language. This program does not use any functions from the hashlib Python built-in library. This was a project that I undertook to better understand how the Sha256 algorithm works. The program consists of a number of fucntions that are designed to manipulate and alter the bits of the message. These functions are then used in the get_Sha256 function which runs the encryption process of the message.

Also included in this repository is a folder containing the Sha256File.py program which hashes files using the functions found in the aforementioned file (in the folder this has been named Sha256.py). Also found in this file are a number of different files in the following formats: .txt, .py, .oga, .wav, .jpg, .avi, .wmv which have been included for testing purposes.
